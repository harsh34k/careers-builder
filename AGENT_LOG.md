Throughout this assignment, I used AI as a **development companion** — to speed up my workflow, clarify concepts faster, and help me focus on product thinking rather than boilerplate.

## How I Used AI

### 1. AI as a Companion, Not a Replacement
I approached AI the same way I would ask a more **experienced developer** sitting next to me.  
I used it to:
- Validate ideas
- Compare alternatives
- Get unstuck quickly

This helped to learn new features implementation.

### 2. Learning New Features Quickly (Example: Drag & Drop)
I had **never implemented drag-and-drop UI** before.  
Instead of spending hours searching blogs or videos, I asked ChatGPT to explain:
- Which library to use (`react-beautiful-dnd` / `@hello-pangea/dnd`)
- How `Droppable` and `Draggable` work
- How to maintain ordering state

I learned this **while building the actual feature** — so “learning by doing,” which saved me time and helped understand concept more clearly.

### 3. Generating Boilerplate & Repetitive Code
I used AI to produce:
- UI skeleton components
- Form markup
- Standard try/catch API scaffolding

This helped me avoid typing repetitive things, so I could focus more on user experience, state flow, and functionality.

### 4. Improving Component & Code Structure
Whenever the code started to get too large in one file (like the Dashboard page), I asked AI how to break it down into reusable components (e.g., Sections Manager, Job Manager).  
This helped me:
- Reduce complexity
- Keep components focused
- Maintain readability

### 5. Fast Learning on Unknown Areas
Sometimes I just needed quick guidance on concepts I didn’t fully know yet — like:
- Preview route authorization patterns
- Best practices for public vs protected pages
- Clean filtering logic for job listings

AI helped me **get to know things which i didn't knew**, so I could continue building.
